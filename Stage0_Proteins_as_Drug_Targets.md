### **Proteins as Drug Targets: a basic introduction**

Authors (@slack): Chamss Daghsni (@ChamssDaghsni)

As a bioengineering student, I'm passionate about cancer research and the important role of proteins in drug discovery. Proteins are basic constituents of biological systems that are often dysregulated in cancer, leading to a therapeutic intervention. This essay explores the role of proteins as drug targets in cancer drug discovery.Â 


### **Defining Drug Targets**

A drug target can be defined as a biological component, mostly a protein, that dictates the characteristics of a disease. The identification of these key drug targets is the first step toward drug discovery. In cancer therapy, proteins are a major target because certain proteins play a significant role in the growth and survival of the tumor cells. For example, the HER2 protein is overexpressed in certain breast cancers and provides a major target for the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, which inhibits HER2 signaling, thereby slowing tumor growth. This provides one possible example of how study of the function of proteins can lead to effective therapies for cancer **(American Cancer Society, 2022)**.


### **The Concept of Druggability**

The concept of "druggability" is also important. A generally druggable protein has a specific three-dimensional structure to which small molecules can effectively bind. In other words, there are characteristics that the binding site of the protein should possess to enable high-affinity and site-specific interactions with drug-like molecules. Finally, a protein has to be associated with some kind of disease process if it is to be considered a viable drug target. As such, manipulation of the activities of such proteins offers avenues through which effective therapies can be developed **(Bull & Doig, 2015)**.


### **Advancements in Drug Target Identification**

Drug target identification has been experimentally based to date, with one approach using differential expression of genes in normal versus tumor cells **(Shaker et al., 2021)**. Together with the advantage of phenotype-based screening, molecular docking, and structure-based drug design, our understanding of protein structures and functions has improved **(Ha et al., 2020)**. Newer methods are covalent conjugation and label-free target identification enabling more efficient ways for protein target discovery. This not only accelerates drug discovery but also opens new perspectives for targeting previously "undruggable" proteins, like KRAS, which is frequently mutated in a wide variety of cancers **(Nature, 2023)**.


### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, proteins are crucial in drug discovery, particularly in cancer treatment. Understanding the role of proteins in disease mechanisms can ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. The process of identifying and developing new therapies for cancer by targeting proteins is stimulating, both intellectually and in the great promise it holds for real change in people's lives.
